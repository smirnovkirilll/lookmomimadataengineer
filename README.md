# Curated must-read/must-watch/must-learn list on Data Landscape (ETL-tools, concepts, etc)

Hello everyone! My name is Kirill, [I'm a data engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smirnovkirilll/) with about 10 years of experience in this field, and here is my list of some data engineering topics. I will be glad if this list helps you navigate or at least is interesting to you.


&nbsp;
### What is it?
- personal must-read/must-watch/must-learn list (articles, videos, courses, books), which is supposed to help to organize learning path in Data Engineering (DE) stuff. it is tagged with topics and I believe it can help to achieve strong versatile knowledge on building of Data Warehouses
- this list can also be used to form an opinion about my area of interest if you would like to collaborate in any way. hope it'll help you to save efforts to know that I'm not good enough at some specific area you need or vice versa - I know something useful for you
- topics that I would like to explore more closely have a special comment "FRIN" (further research is needed)
- in a very limited sense it maybe can help you to know more about Data Engineering itself. limitations arise from first two points: it is not general-purpose list at all, it reflects only my experience and interests (next section tells more on it)
- if you are supposed to be a member of my team (I hire employees from time to time) here are some topics that might be discussed during the hiring process
- the main topic of this post - Data Engineering, but as it does not exist in vacuum and often accompanied with other tasks, I'm also interested in related crafts, like: DevOps, MLOps, BI, Data Analysis, Data Modeling. For now these themes included sporadically, but as DE profession widening in time and absorbing more and more (and more often become Analytics Engineering), useful to know at least where you should watch
- the word "curated" in the title hardly needs an explanation. however, I will stipulate that the content is indeed selected quite carefully, in the future I will add new elements, those that no longer make sense will be removed, etc.


&nbsp;
### What it is not?
- this post can't answer properly to the question "how do i become a Data Engineer?", the reader should already know it. but i've made small section "basics" on this topic as a reminder on where to start search of proper answers
- it can't, doesn't intent and would not illuminate all the tools/technics and methods of Data Landscape. according to the [MAD map](https://mad.firstmark.com) there are more than 2000 tools (ML, AI & Data) and counting. no one knows it all, absolutely no sense to require that knowledge from candidate you speaking to (much more reasonable to ask methodics of data processing and tasks ever solved). that's why this post aimed to observe some tools (tiny part of the spectrum), which are industry standard or close to or has perspectives to become or just reflects my personal preferences
- it is not objective, as I have preferences and biases: [Big Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company) technological stack. if needed to adjust to some specific techno-stack, [by-company map](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/stacks) could be useful to choose proper tools
- it is not objective, as I am natively speaking russian, most of materials are in Russian (other in English)

### Few words for entry-level engineers
**one should already know a lot of stuff to pretend to be a junior engineer, e.g.:**
- algorithms (entry level) - [Алгоритмы и структуры данных (Сергей Бабичев)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrCZzMib1e9pDxHYzmEzMmnMMUK-dz0_7)
- linux shell - [Effective Shell (Dave Kerr)](https://effective-shell.com)
- python (entry level) - [Python (Сергей Лебедев)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlb7e2G7aSpTTNp7HBYzCBByaE1h54ruW)
- SQL - [SQL Cookbook (Anthony Molinaro)](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Cookbook-Solutions-Techniques-Developers/dp/0596009763)
- any popular RDBMS (Postgresql, Mysql, Oracle,..)
- dataframes juggling (e.g. pandas)

**next level engineer will have to know elsemore:**
- [Intro to Database Systems (CMU)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbj8BMuIrRcacnQh20hmY9g)
- [Advanced Database Systems (CMU)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYa_zX-KeMJui7pcN1rIaIJ)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmann)](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
- [Методы и системы обработки больших данных (Иван Пузыревский)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-_cKNuVAYAVJJRItmIfqft4HtAmaNgB4)
- one also should [understand expectations](https://gopractice.ru/skills/data_analysts_levels) for engineers of different grades (article is about analysts, but it's so good and can easily be projected on engineers, so I can strongly recommend it)
  - little bit more on levels:
    - [brief review](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/swe-level-framework.html) on software engineer levels (by levels.fyi)
    - [unnecessarily detailed](https://github.com/avito-tech/playbook/blob/master/developer-profile.md) set of developers profiles. as for me, this is more corporate nonsense than helping someone progress. but if ignore that part on performance review, it still could be useful for self-development (by avito)

**everything else in the list is much more specific and much less fundamental**, so this is a basics.
